A mod for R.E.P.O to recharge your items in between rounds. Got help from Its_alex on Discord

  

# Config

  

Customize the amount you want to charge your items.

  

For example on Dynamic: if your item is at 25% and you have the Config set to 50%, then your battery will be charged to 75%.

For Static, if your item is at if your item is at 25% and you have the Config set to 50%, then your battery will be charged to 50%

  

### Dynamic

Adds the charge on top of charge that was left over from the last round.

### Static

Always sets the battery to the value no matter what the battery level is.
